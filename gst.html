        <h1>Goods & Service Tax (GST)</h1>

        <p>
            India, being a federal country, has adopted a dual GST model to cater to the diverse
            interests of its states. This approach divides the power to tax various transactions
            between the Union and the States and is characterized by a four-rate structure designed
            to accommodate varying state requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            The government has actively addressed challenges faced by trade and industry during the
            transition, resulting in numerous exemptions and concessions within the evolving GST
            framework.
        </p>

        <h2>Dual GST with a Four-Rate Structure</h2>

        <p>
            Our GST services go beyond basic compliance. We benchmark your tax position against
            industry standards and competitors while reviewing internal controls and accounting
            systems to identify operational and financial improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
            This enables us to uncover actionable insights—such as faster receivables cycles,
            optimized stock levels, streamlined order fulfillment processes, and improved cash flow
            through strategic tax planning.
        </p>

        <h2>A Historical Perspective</h2>

        <p>
            Historically, India’s taxation system divided taxing powers between Central and State
            governments. This extended to indirect taxes such as excise duty, service tax, sales tax,
            and VAT.
        </p>

        <p>
            The result was multiple tax rates, complex compliance requirements, and non-creditable
            taxes, leading to double taxation and artificial inefficiencies within businesses.
        </p>

        <h2>The GST Revolution</h2>

        <p>
            The landmark GST reform implemented in July 2017 replaced this complex web of taxes with
            a unified regime. Although India’s GST system remains relatively intricate, it has
            largely achieved tax neutrality, allowing businesses to focus on core operations rather
            than tax structuring.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Unresolved Issues</h2>

        <p>
            Like any evolving tax system, GST faces unresolved challenges, including transition
            procedures, treatment of intangible assets, anti-profiteering provisions, exemptions in
            backward areas, classification disputes, refund mechanisms, input tax credits,
            tripartite contracts, loyalty programs, trade promotion schemes, and securitization-
            related complexities.
